// Your working on a "Workout" app and your task is to start and stop timers when users
// click the "Start" and "Stop" buttons of a selected workout.

// You're provided with some code that already displays some workout items, therefore, 
// you don't need to work on the JSX code or manage any state.

// Instead, your task is to set a timer if the "Start" button is clicked and clear (stop) that timer once the "Stop" button is clicked.

// If a timer expires, the same code that should execute if it's stopped manually (by pressing the "Stop" button) should be executed.

// The timer expiration time should be different for every workout - take a closer look
// at the Workout component to get access to that workout-specific time.

// You also must make sure that different Workout component instances set and manage separate,
// independent timers (i.e., when starting timers for "Pushups" and "Squats", clicking "Stop" for "Squats" should not stop the "Pushups" timer etc).

// When a timer expires, the same function that's triggered when the "Stop" button is pressed should be executed.
